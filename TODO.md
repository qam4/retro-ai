# TODO

## Tools
- Generic RAM watcher tool: boot a game, take snapshots on user-triggered
  events (score change, death, level complete), auto-categorize addresses
  as score-like, lives-like, timer-like, or position-like. Should work with
  any emulator (videopac, mo5). Generalize from scripts/ram_watcher.py.

## Performance
- Save state on first reset for instant subsequent resets. The startup
  sequence (LOAD/RUN/menu for MO5, BIOS/Key1 for videopac) runs once,
  saves state, then restore_state on every reset(). Saves ~32s per reset
  on MO5 Yeti, ~5s on videopac Satellite Attack.
- ~~Skip rendering on intermediate frame_skip frames~~ — DONE (step_n uses
  run_frame(false) for intermediate frames on both videopac and crayon).
  Needs benchmarking: run emulator throughput test with and without skip-render
  to measure actual speedup. GPU-bound training may mask the improvement.

## Tech Debt
- MO5 BIOS paths passed via reward_params hack — should be proper
  constructor params on MO5RLInterface (like videopac has bios_path).
- Videopac RL interface hardcodes NTSC — should be configurable per game
  profile or auto-detected from BIOS.
- Resume training passes total_timesteps to model.learn() without subtracting
  checkpoint's num_timesteps, causing it to train total+checkpoint steps
  instead of total steps. Fix: remaining = total - model.num_timesteps.
